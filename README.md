# Cross-Asset-Dynamics-and-Crisis-Contagion-in-U.S.-Equities
Multivariate Time Series and Volatility Modeling in Equity Markets
• Conducted cointegration and unit root analysis on quarterly price data of four stocks using ADF and Johansen tests, finding evidence of up to three cointegrating relationships, with discussion on implications for market efficiency.
• Modelled volatility using GARCH and MGARCH frameworks (RiskMetrics, DCC, BEKK) across NVIDIA, Amazon, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble; DCC-GARCH provided the best fit, capturing persistent volatility and dynamic cross-asset correlations.
• Performed contagion testing using Forbes-Rigobon and Frey et al. (2010) methods, revealing statistically significant contagion from Microsoft to Procter & Gamble during crises, supported by changes in higher moments and coskewness.
• Compared alternative volatility measures using high-frequency JPMorgan data, showing realized volatility from 5-min returns provides reactive insights, while GARCH (1,1) captures persistence—validating literature findings on combining both for robust risk forecasting.
